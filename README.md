# GeneScoreR
Gene Scoring from Genomic Count Tables

GeneScoreR is an R package that automatically calculates gene scores from gene count tables, providing two methods for scoring: the z-score method, which requires a table of samples being scored and a count table, and the geometric mean method, which does not rely on control samples.
